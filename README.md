## Known issue in the current release

**The app may return you to the login screen after being left open for a long
time.** Your sign-in lasts 7 days and the desktop app does not renew it
automatically, so once it lapses the next click logs you out — and the screen may
flicker between pages until you quit and reopen the app.

Signing in again clears it. Your data is never affected. A fix is in progress.

## Installing on macOS

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the **TabeebHub** icon onto the **Applications** folder shown beside it.
3. Open TabeebHub from your Applications folder or Launchpad.

That's it. TabeebHub is notarized by Apple, so macOS will not show a security warning.

## Installing on Windows

1. Click the Windows download link above and wait for the file to finish downloading.
2. Open **TabeebHub-Setup.exe**.
3. **Windows will show a blue warning screen.** This is expected — see below.
4. Choose the install location (or accept the default) and click **Install**.
5. TabeebHub installs for the current user only. **No administrator password is required.**

### About the "Windows protected your PC" warning

When you open the installer, Windows SmartScreen will show:

> **Windows protected your PC**
> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

**To continue: click "More info", then click "Run anyway".**

This warning does **not** mean the file is unsafe or damaged. Windows shows it for any
application it has not yet seen downloaded many times. It will disappear on its own as
more clinics install TabeebHub.

If your clinic's IT policy blocks unrecognised applications, give your IT administrator
the checksum below — it lets them confirm the file is exactly the one we published.

## Verifying the download (for IT administrators)

Every release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file listing the expected hash for each file.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\TabeebHub-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

**macOS:**

```bash
shasum -a 256 TabeebHub-arm64.dmg
```

Compare the result against `SHA256SUMS.txt` on the
[latest release page](https://github.com/abdullahbayomy/tabeebhub-releases/releases/latest).
If they match, the file is byte-for-byte what we published.

The macOS builds are additionally signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and
notarized by Apple. You can confirm this yourself:

```bash
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 /Applications/TabeebHub.app
# expected: accepted   source=Notarized Developer ID
```
