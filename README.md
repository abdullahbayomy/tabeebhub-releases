## What's new in 1.0.5

**Reception can now close out a visit.** The front desk gets a checkout on the
appointment screen: what the visit came to, the procedures and services it was
for, the payment — full or partial — and the next booking. All of it without
opening the clinical workspace, which stays with the doctor.

**Services keep up with the doctor.** When the doctor adds a service or marks a
session used, the front desk sees it straight away, with the session that was
just completed called out. A finished course stays on screen instead of
disappearing mid-checkout, and a service bought more than once is now
distinguishable by when it was started.

**From this version the app updates itself.** New releases download in the
background and install when you quit — no more downloading an installer.

> Updating **from 1.0.4 or earlier** still needs a one-time manual download using
> the links above. Those versions have no updater in them; 1.0.5 is the first
> that can update on its own.

## Fixed in 1.0.4 — being returned to the login screen

Earlier releases could send you back to the login screen while you were working:
after the app had been left open for a long time, after the machine woke from
sleep, or simply after the app was reloaded. Nothing had actually rejected your
sign-in, and on some occasions signing in again did not hold.

**This is fixed in 1.0.4.** Sessions now renew on their own, a brief network
problem no longer ends one, and your sign-in survives a reload and a restart.

If you are running an older version, update using the links above. Your data was
never affected by any of this.

## Installing on macOS

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the **TabeebHub** icon onto the **Applications** folder shown beside it.
3. Open TabeebHub from your Applications folder or Launchpad.

That's it. TabeebHub is notarized by Apple, so macOS will not show a security warning.

---

## Installing on Windows

1. Click the Windows download link above and wait for the file to finish downloading.
2. Open **TabeebHub-Setup.exe**.
3. **Windows will show a blue warning screen.** This is expected — see below.
4. Choose the install location (or accept the default) and click **Install**.
5. TabeebHub installs for the current user only. **No administrator password is required.**

### About the "Windows protected your PC" warning

When you open the installer, Windows SmartScreen will show:

> **Windows protected your PC**
> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

**To continue: click "More info", then click "Run anyway".**

This warning does **not** mean the file is unsafe or damaged. Windows shows it for any
application it has not yet seen downloaded many times. It will disappear on its own as
more clinics install TabeebHub.

If your clinic's IT policy blocks unrecognised applications, give your IT administrator
the checksum below — it lets them confirm the file is exactly the one we published.

## Verifying the download (for IT administrators)

Every release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file listing the expected hash for each file.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\TabeebHub-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

**macOS:**

```bash
shasum -a 256 TabeebHub-arm64.dmg
```

Compare the result against `SHA256SUMS.txt` on the
[latest release page](https://github.com/abdullahbayomy/tabeebhub-releases/releases/latest).
If they match, the file is byte-for-byte what we published.

The macOS builds are additionally signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and
notarized by Apple. You can confirm this yourself:

```bash
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 /Applications/TabeebHub.app
# expected: accepted   source=Notarized Developer ID
```
